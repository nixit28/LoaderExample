Loader API Example
==================

I have created this project as an demo of how can we use Loader API

Thing Covered
-------

* [AsyncTaskLoader](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html)
* [LoaderManager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/LoaderManager.html)
* [LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks.html)

Objective
------------

In this project I have created a Custom [AsyncTaskLoader] (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html) which is responsible for the loading of data.
My objective was to load the data from the server Asynchronously in to ListView, and data can be changed based on the content of the EditText.
I am currently having data from the yahoo finance api which returns the Json Response so, I am parding it and simply showing in to list view.

Thanks to Loader Api It look so simple and ease on the phone
